# Introduction  
This script scans all VNETs in a subscription and lists available IP addresses for each subnet.  
It will list the subnets which have less than 50% IP addresses available, or the percentage sected by user.  

This can be used as a runbook in Azure Automation or any other such solution. 
Alerts can be triggered based on the output of this script.
